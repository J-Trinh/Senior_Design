Our system consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item An Odroid XU4 module
\item A Cypress CX3 interface
\item Infrared LEDs
\item A MIPI camera
 \end{itemize}
We are going to have a pair of glasses with a camera and infrared LED attached to it. We are going to track the dominant eye which is the right eye for most people. We will project  infrared light into the userâ€™s eye and using our camera, capture frames(data) which will be processed by an algorithm to track the location of the pupil. We will perform this process in a loop to get a video of the pupil being tracked.
