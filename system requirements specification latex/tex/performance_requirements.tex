The following paragraph describes the requirements for performance that are necessary for the Eye Tracker to perform at a more than acceptable level for extended periods of time, and with a reasonable product life.
Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. Performance requirements address items such as: how fast specific critical operations must complete; how long it takes to start/stop activities; how long the battery must last; maximum time it must take to set up; etc.
