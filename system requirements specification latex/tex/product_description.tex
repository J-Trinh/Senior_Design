The purpose is to give the document reader/reviewer enough information about the product to allow them to easily follow the specification of requirements found in the remainder of the document. Your header for this section should introduce the section with a brief statement such as: "This section provides the reader with an overview of X. The primary operational aspects of the product, from the perspective of end users, maintainers and administrators, are defined here. The key features and functions found in the product, as well as critical user interactions and user interfaces are described in detail." Using words, and pictures or graphics where possible, specify the following:

\subsection{Features \& Functions}
The main function of the product will be to keep track of the pupil, and will accomplish this using a combination of the Cypress-CX3 MIPI to USB interface board to pull the camera data and the Odroid-XU4 to process the images and track the pupil.


\subsection{External Inputs \& Outputs}
There will be no external data processed by the product.
The only output from our product will be what the camera is seeing and the position of the pupil in the image.

\subsection{Product Interfaces}
There are currently no plans to implement a user interface, we may implement one later but it is a low priority task.
