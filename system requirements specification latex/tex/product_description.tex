\subsection{Features \& Functions}
The main function of the product will be to keep track of the pupil, and will accomplish this using a combination of the Cypress-CX3 MIPI to USB interface board to pull the camera data and the Odroid-XU4 to process the images and track the pupil.


\subsection{External Inputs \& Outputs}
There will be no external data processed by the product.
The only output from our product will be what the camera is seeing and the position of the pupil in the image.

\subsection{Product Interfaces}
There are currently no plans to implement a user interface, we may implement one later but it is a low priority task.
